                        This is a simple as it gets, a single oscillator.  So, let me take
                        this opportunity to explain a bit about how this program works.

                        Playing the Instrument
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        What you're looking at here is a representation of an instrument.
                        You can ask the instrument to play a note for a period of time at
                        using the controls at the bottom of the page.  Try it.  Try using different
                        frequencies and different durations.  You can put either numeric frequencies
                        like 138.59 or note names C#3 into the frequency box.  The duration is the
                        length of time in seconds that the note will play.  If you want the
                        note to just keep playing till you give further instructions set
                        Duration to 0 or leave it blank.  You can play around with things
                        while the instrument is playing to see how your changes sound.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instruments created with WebAudioGUI are designed to be monophonic.
                        That means, they aren't designed to play more than one note at
                        the same time (though you can have many oscillators on different
                        frequency to make up that one note, see tutorial 3).
                        You can tell it to start playing a new note before
                        the old one is finished, but it won't always give you the result
                        you'd hope for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometime, I will license the software for the underlying javascript
                        object so that you can use the instruments you build on your own website.
                        Multiple copies of the same instrument can be created to play so that
                        as many notes as you have RAM for can be played at once.
                        When you tell the javascript object to play a note, you tell it the note and the
                        start and end time.  I've also written a sequencer that that can be
                        used to get the instrument to play a whole song.  To check it out, 
                        click the gear icon at the top right and then "Music Sheet Tutorial."

            <div data-tutorial='2' data-caption='Connections [osc,gain]'>
                <p>
                    For those of you familiar with the web audio api, you'll see that
                    all the features of OscillatorNodes and GainNodes are represented here.</p>
                <h4>Connections - inputs, outputs, and AudioParams</h4>
                <p>
                    At the top of the nodes, you see their outputs.  At the bottom
                    you see connection targets: inputs and AudioParams.  Click an
                    output and drag to a connection target to make a connection.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div data-tutorial='3' data-caption='Parameters[2osc]'>
                <h3>Parameters</h3>
                <p>Here we have two oscillators that both play when you tell the instrument to play.
                    But they don't play the same frequency.  See where the first oscillator's
                    frequency is set to <code>f</code> while the second oscillator's frequency
                    is set to <code>f*2</code>?.  The <code>f</code> is a variable that
                    will be filled in with the note you tell the instrument to play.
                    When you tell the instrument to play A3, whose frequency is 220,
                    the first oscillator starts up at 220, the second at 220*2 = 440 (one octave up).
                </p>
                <p>Nearly all WebAudioGUI input boxes can be put in terms of <code>f</code>.
                    If you want the instrument to get quieter as the instrument
                    frequency gets higher, try setting the gain to 440/f.  The input boxes are
                    powered by <a href="www.mathjs.org">mathjs</a>.  If you put something
                    into the input box that mathjs can't parse, the input box border will
                    turn red.  Entering <code>2+</code> will get you red border. Two plus what?
                    <code>2*x</code> will also get you red border because x isn't defined.</p>
                <p>Of course, you can also put constants in the input boxes.  If you wanted to try to 
                    build a bagpipe, with one drone note that stays the same pitch regardless
                    of what pitch the instrument is playing, you could make an oscillator with 
                    a frequency of <code>110</code>, for example.</p>
                <p>One of the cool things you can do in these boxes is <a data-hint='Read <code>f>440 ? 0.5 : 1</code> like this: "Is f greater than 440? If so, then 0.5. Otherwise, 1.'
                                                                          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator">conditional statements</a>.
                    Say you want an oscillator to play at half volume if the instrument frequency is above 440 and
                    at full volume otherwise.  In the gain box, enter <code>f>440 ? 0.5 : 1</code>.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-tutorial='4' data-caption='Connecting to AudioParams'>
                <h3>Connecting to AudioParams</h3>
                <p>
                    This one works best if you make the duration box in the footer blank so the instrument
                    keeps playing until you tap "stop" or give it a different note.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What does an oscillator send through its output?  A very rapid
                    series of numbers ranging between -1 and 1.  When you connect an 
                    oscillator to an AudioParam, like the grayish oscillator is connected to 
                    the gain parameter, it sends all those numbers to the parameter.
                    The real time gain of the gain node is <code>1</code> (because that's what
                    it says in the gain input box) plus whatever number it just got from the oscillator.
                    So, the real time gain is going to vary between 1+-1=0 to 1+1=2, and that's just what
                    you see happening in the VolumeOverTime graph once you hit play.  Cool, right?
                    Try changing the <code>type</code> of the grayish Oscillator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The frequency of the grayish oscillator is <code>1/2</code> hz, so it goes through a whole cycle 
                    every two seconds. Play around with it.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div data-tutorial='5' data-caption='Time Parameters'>
                <h3>Set Value at Time</h3>
                <p>The AudioParams in the Web Audio API
                    have methods like <code>setValueAtTime</code>, <code>linearRampToValueAtTime</code>,
                    <code>exponentialRampToValueAtTime</code>, etc. These methods are represented as nodes
                    here in the Web Audio GUI.  You can see that the inputs boxes here 
                    the variables <code>s</code> and <code>e</code>.  These stand for Start and End.  
                    Remember that what you are designing an instrument that plays a note beginning at 
                    a time and ending at a time.  The variables <code>s</code> and <code>e</code> will
                    be replaced with those times, measured in seconds.  For this example, make sure
                    you have something appropriate in the duration box. <code>1</code> works nicely.
                    If you schedule things to happen before the start time or after the end time, 
                    they won't work right. So you shouldn't use <code>s-0.5</code> or <code>e+1</code>.
                    If you're duration is 1, you shouldn't schedule anything at <code>s+1.1</code> 
                    or even <code>s+1</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Play with things and play notes while watching the volume over time graph. Longer 
                    durations will help you see the shape of ramping better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The variables <code>s</code> and <code>e</code> technically work in other input boxes
                    too, so if you wanted longer notes to be louder, you could set gain to e-s 
                    (note sure why you'd want to).  The variable <code>f</code> also works in 
                    the time functions, so you could have a slower ramp up (attack) for lower
                    notes if you wanted.
                </p>
                <p>This works best when the input box in the gain is set to 0.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-tutorial='6' data-caption='FM Synthesis'>
                <p>This is an FM synth example.  The frequency of one  
                    oscillator is modified by another.</p>
                <p>The amount  
                    of frequency modulation is controlled by the GainNode.  Typically  
                    amount of modulation is measured by modulation index.  You can calculate the 
                    modulation index as gain / the frequency of the pink  
                    oscillator (the modulator).  So, when the modultor's frequency is <code>f*2</code>, 
                    and the gain is <code>f*2 *1</code>, the index of modulation is 1.  
                    If you leave the modulator's frequency at <code>f*2</code>, you can get a  
                    modulation index of 3 by setting the gain to <code>f*2*3</code>.  If you change the modulator's frequency  
                    to <code>f*1</code>, but want to keep a modulation index of 1, change the gain to <code>f*1 *1</code></p>
                <p>The phase difference between  
                    the modulator and the carrier doesn't really affect sound (throw a  
                    TimeBasedSpectrogram in there to have a look), but it does unfortunately  
                    affect the volume a bit (throw in a VolumeOverTimeGraph).  But most of all,  
                    it affects the shape of the wave form.  If you want to get the WaveForm graph to
                    look something like it does in <a  
                        href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AFrequencymodulationdemo-td.png' target='_blank'>this 
                    </a> image, you'll need to fool with the phase shift some.</p>
                <p>The Web Audio API unfortunately doesn't keep track of phases.  There are no guarantees about
                    the phase difference between two oscillators will be the same if you build
                    two copies of the instrument.  For that matter, it seems like phase differences
                    can change over time even in one instance of an instrument.  So, don't rely on
                    ***PhaseShift for anything important.</p>

            <div data-tutorial='7' data-caption='FileSource and Convolver'>
                <h3>FileSource and Convolver</h3>
                <p>The most straightforward uses the Web Audio API's BufferSource and
                    Convolver nodes rely on external files.  Currently, Web Audio GUI
                    only allows the use of files in the users file system.  Obviously when
                    I start licensing the instrument and sequencer software, there will
                    be a way to link to server files.</p>
                <p>Click the "Choose" button on the FileSource node and select a music file
                    or something from your hard drive (don't worry, nothing is uploaded to
                    my server, I won't know what kind of music you like).  Chrome's implementation 
                    of the Web Audio API can read many types of audio files.  Try your
                    preferred type and see if it works.</p>
                <p>To use the Convolver, download an audio file that represents an impulse response.
                    Fokke van Saane has made some available to the public 
                    <a href="http://fokkie.home.xs4all.nl/IR.htm">here</a>.  I suggest
                    the <a href="http://fokkie.home.xs4all.nl/IR.htm#Schellingwoude">Small church Schellingwoude</a>.
                    If you don't want to deal with a .sit archive, download the .zip version.  
                    Unpack it and find the .wav file.  Click "Choose" in the Convolver and 
                    select that .wav file.</p>
                <p>Then set the duration to blank and push play.  If you want to hear how
                    your audio file sounds without convolution, detach the Covolver from 
                    the destination.  To hear it all the way convovled, detach the oscillator from
                    the destination.</p>

                            adjusting the volume of each part independently.  It's easy to 
                            get the hang of. To get started, click the gear icon at the top right
                            and select "MusicSheet Tutorial" from the menu.</p>
                        <p>If you sing in a choir, this is great for 
                            letting you hear just your part of a section of music, 
                            or just your part with the other parts quieter. If you 
                            are a choir director, you can enter a piece of music and 
                            then export what you've done and email it your members 
                            to import for themselves (copyright permitting, of course).

                        <p>As the name suggests, the intention here is to make a graphical

                            You get flowchart-style graphical audio nodes. You can drag and drop 
                            connections among them and adjust their parameters in a flexible way.  
                            The tutorial here is stored as a series of instruments.
